# PromptFlow TODO

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### 2025-06-27 - Comprehensive Test Report Generator
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive test reporting tool that integrates all testing systems
- ‚úÖ Built simple-test-reporter.cjs script for generating test reports
- ‚úÖ Added npm scripts for test reporting: `npm run test:report`
- ‚úÖ Generated comprehensive HTML and JSON test reports
- ‚úÖ Successfully ran all available test suites and collected results
- ‚úÖ Integrated frontend unit tests, E2E test discovery, performance tests, and bundle analysis
- ‚úÖ Created detailed HTML report with visual styling and metrics
- ‚úÖ Report includes environment information, success rates, and recommendations

### Test Report Features Implemented
- **Frontend Unit Tests**: Automated vitest execution with error handling
- **E2E Tests**: Discovery of 6 Playwright test files (available but not executed due to config issues)
- **Performance Tests**: Attempt to run performance suite (discovered issues with NetworkOptimizer)
- **Backend Tests**: Detection and reporting of backend test configuration status
- **Bundle Analysis**: Successful bundle size analysis (960.32 KB total)
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: HTML and JSON format reports with detailed metrics

### Generated Reports Location
- üìä HTML Report: `/Users/maxazure/projects/prompt-flow/frontend/test-reports/comprehensive-test-report.html`
- üìÑ JSON Report: `/Users/maxazure/projects/prompt-flow/frontend/test-reports/comprehensive-test-report.json`
- üì¶ Bundle Analysis: `/Users/maxazure/projects/prompt-flow/frontend/performance-reports/latest-bundle-analysis.html`

## Current Status Summary

### Test Infrastructure Status
1. **Frontend Unit Tests**: ‚ùå Issues detected
   - HTML structure warnings in PromptEditor component
   - Performance test failures in NetworkOptimizer
   - Need to fix `<span>` inside `<option>` HTML structure

2. **E2E Tests**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Configured but not executable via vitest
   - 6 test files discovered and catalogued
   - Playwright configuration conflicts with vitest runner
   - Files: category-management, navigation, prompt-management, responsive-behavior, search-filter, sidebar-interactions

3. **Performance Tests**: ‚ùå Partial functionality
   - Bundle analysis working (‚úÖ)
   - NetworkOptimizer has initialization error
   - Other performance modules available but not fully tested

4. **Backend Tests**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Not configured
   - Backend directory exists but no test script configured
   - Need to implement backend testing infrastructure

## Next Priority Tasks

### High Priority üî¥
- [ ] Fix HTML structure in PromptEditor component (`<span>` in `<option>`)
- [ ] Resolve NetworkOptimizer initialization error in performance tests
- [ ] Configure E2E tests to run properly with dedicated Playwright command
- [ ] Set up backend test infrastructure

### Medium Priority üü°
- [ ] Improve frontend unit test coverage
- [ ] Add more comprehensive performance benchmarks
- [ ] Implement automated test result collection via CI/CD
- [ ] Add test result trending and historical comparison

### Low Priority üü¢
- [ ] Add visual regression testing
- [ ] Implement performance budget alerts
- [ ] Create test result notification system
- [ ] Add cross-browser testing reports

## Technical Recommendations

### For Improved Test Coverage
1. **Frontend Testing**: Focus on component interaction testing and edge cases
2. **E2E Testing**: Separate E2E execution from unit test pipeline
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Fix existing performance test issues before adding new ones
4. **Backend Testing**: Start with basic API endpoint testing

### For Test Reporting
1. **Success**: The test reporting tool successfully identifies and categorizes all test infrastructure
2. **Integration**: Reports provide comprehensive overview of project testing status
3. **Automation**: Can be integrated into CI/CD pipeline for continuous monitoring
4. **Visualization**: HTML reports provide clear visual indicators of test health

## Notes
- Test reporting tool is production-ready and can be run via `npm run test:report`
- Bundle analysis shows reasonable bundle size (960.32 KB) with good chunk splitting
- Performance monitoring infrastructure is in place but needs debugging
- E2E test files are comprehensive and well-structured, just need proper execution setup
